This website is dedicated to sharing research on how the distinctive climatic features of Southeast Asia have shaped its diverse agricultural systems. The East Asian monsoon region is often referred to as the "Green Belt" due to its continuous vegetation gradient stretching from the equator to northern East Asiaâ€”an ecological pattern rarely found elsewhere in the world.

In this region, humans and nature have interacted over thousands of years, giving rise to highly detailed and sophisticated agricultural systems. These systems have evolved in ways that differ significantly from modern agriculture, which has primarily developed in Western and other parts of East Asia.

On this website, I plan to gradually publish revised versions of my previous work, including R code used in past analyses.
